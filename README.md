Created this simple monthly expenses canculator with the catogeries "Food","Rent","Health","Retirement","Gym ","Funstuff","Others" using the database with sqlite3 and tkinter. The database consist of the 3 columns i.e catogery, date, amount.We execute 'create table command' only once at the beginning of the project I have used different types of tkinter object for taking the input form user like 'OptionMenu','Label','Entry'and 'Button'. For the functioning part we have defined different function connected with buttons line submit() for subbimiting the new data,delete_record() for deleteing the record form data,showing_records() for showing the records and graph() for displaying a pie graph from the fetched data using matplotlib library In data base we have initiated every catogery with amount 0 and every time a user enter the new data the submit() executes the update command .The reason to do so is that we cant display a pie chart of total number of catogery(7) with less than 7 values in database . In submit() if user select new-month ,the old data is again set ot 0 for all all the catogeries delete_record() wil simply set amount of every value to 0 showing_records() will simply fetch all the data from tha database and display it in new windows
